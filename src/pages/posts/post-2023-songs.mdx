Welcome to my _new blog_ about music! I spent a lot more time working on the technical side of this one, so I hope it beats your expectations!

## Introduction

I can link internally to [my conclusion](#conclusion) on the same page when writing Markdown.

<div>
    {
      songs
        .reverse()
        .map((albo) => <AlbumCard place={albo.Place} artist={albo.Artist} album={albo.Album} image={albo.Image} writeup={albo.Writeup}/>)
    }
</div>

## Conclusion

Boy do I want to make it work.

Hotline TNT	Cartwheel	November 3	9.4	5.0	★★★★★	shoegaze	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OpsbB+m3L.jpg	Hotline TNT
Caroline Polachek	Desire, I Want To Turn Into You	February 16	9.3	4.9	★★★★★	pop, tender, vocally	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fz6o1OlKL.jpg	Caroline's post-Chairlift output has seen her embracing synthesized ultra-pop, while continuining to flex her incredible vocal range. Desire features less of previous album Pang's PC Music collaboration, but Caroline's own production more than fills the gap in the last half of the album.
Parannoul	After the Magic	January 28	9.2	4.7	★★★★✬	discordant, electronic	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wJMxowwyL.jpg	Trading the stochastic and crunchy noise of 2021's To See the Next Part of The Dream for streamlined melodies and vocals brings Parannoul's songcraft into the focus. Adding texture in this more traditional way gives the album room to breath and tell a more varied story with new varying instrumentation.
boygenius	the record	March 31	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie, alternative, boy	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uivya+h7L.jpg	The year of the boy comes to a close with a phenomenal, mainstream crossover smash from boygenius. What started as a passion project from three, quietly adored singer-songwriters exploded into a worldwise sensation and the record reflects the hyper focus necessary to spend a year making music and touring with your supergroup like this. Also it's wonderfully sapphic and I know my friends like that, and I really appreciate all the silly little outfits they put Julien into this year.
Black Country, New Road	Live at Bush Hall	March 24	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	dark, discordant, tender	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bEx6EPcbL.jpgg	"Don't waste your pearls on me" is echoed across album powerhouse song "Turbines/Pigs", ten minutes long and set against beautiful and wandering piano notes. BCNR were forced to reinvent themselves after the departure of frontman Isaac Woods, but have metamorphised into a tender new sound cut through with their old intensity.
Wednesday	Rat Saw God	April 7	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie, dark, shoegaze, epic	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1rvMu6efFL.jpgg	Wednesday mixes styles and influences seamlessly, bouncing between classic indie and noisy shoegazes with effortless aplomb. All this to craft a dark album with a laser focus.
Home Is Where	the whaler	June 16	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	emo	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91zvM+SKfEL.jpg	I spent my fair share of the last couple years beating my friends over the head with this band's 2021 EP, I Became Birds. Technically their first LP, the whaler brings out the expertly crafted stochastic emo of Home Is Where to paint portraits of every kind of modern angst.
DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ	Destiny	August 18	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	pop, dance	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HLlkJ8ufL.jpgg	The most ascendant DJSTTDJ collection, an album of such length and power it transcends the medium, finds Sabrina in the throes of crafting seamless beats for almost four hours. Any song can be played at any moment, which is necessary to try to even fit this album into one's daily life, and a wave of comforting, stimulating dance music will follow. Somehow, inhumanly, full of bangers from start to finish.
Ratboys	The Window	August 25	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie,punk	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NZX4MYeaL.jpgg	This album made me emotionally attached to windows.
Jeff Rosenstock	HELLMODE	September 5	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie,punk	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61J7xpqGc4L.jpg	Jeff Rosenstock has long since transcended ska punk, finding himself at the nexus of cathartic indie while still mixing the ska tinged anthems he's known for. Few albums this year have captured the utter chaos we are forced to confront every day, but HELLMODE smashes right into that with room to contemplate our deepest of feelings too.
Mitski	The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We	September 15	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EdGU1MkWL.jpg	Having mature alongside the earlier Mitski works, I often suffer whiplash from the quality of the later releases. Mitski rarely reinvents her sound, every album is an incremental step forward and each one cements her songcraft further.
Sufjan Stevens	Javelin	October 6	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie, beloved	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1mH2ERj9wL.jpgg	It is 2023, I am enraptured by Sufjan's combination of experimentation and personal expression. It is 2015, I am enraptured by Sufjan's combination of experimentation and personal expression. It is 2010, I am enraptured by Sufjan's combination of experimentation and personal expression. 
Jane Remover	Census Designated	October 25	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie, noise, experimental	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1f3YS+v-9L.jpg	Arriving at a hodgepodge of shoegaze-cum-rock with insanely distorted instrumentation and hushed vocals, Jane Remover builds a rich but empty void on Census Designated.
ANOHNI And The Johnsons	My Back Was A Bridge For You To Cross	July 10	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	indie,experimental	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/914Bf5hDLLL.jpg	I've loved ANOHNI since 2016's HOPELESSNESS, and working again with Antony and the Johnsons to craft a spell-binding and emotionally raw album filled me with delight.
Olivia Rodrigo	Guts	September 10	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	pop	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91rzIsvpwjL.jpg	Olivia has done what so many have tried and so few have succeeded at: no longer being a Disney kid. GUTS represents an obvious depature from the mouse, but it really shines as a synthesis of pop and pop-adjacent genres to create an insanely fun and listenable album. 
Cupide & Psyche	Romantic Music	October 24	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	electronic,indie, chill, shoegaze	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Xw+CG3CQL.jpg	Some might say this duo trends closer to dream pop, but for me it feels like The Cure reincarnate. Whistful vocals and otherworldly melodies remind me of classic new wave sounds, and I found this album innately listenable.
Militarie Gun	Life Under The Gun	June 23	9.1	4.6	★★★★✬	post-hardcore	https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2879944826_16.jpg	All it takes is one minute of listening to Militarie Gun before the first "OOH OOH" shatters your ego and it's all over from there.
Yo La Tengo	This Stupid World	February 10	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	90s, discordant, guitar-forward	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VEUahCBTL.jpg	Love to see YLT back at, a classic band that works together so seamlessly every new album is almost an instant classic for them.
100 gecs	10,000 gecs	March 17	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	hyperpop,fun,gec	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91QTTTJzp4L.jpg	My achilles heel incarnate, every time something gecs comes out I think to myself "I'm past the gecs, I'm an adult and responsible snake parent, I don't need hyperpop this badly." And I'm wrong; I need this shit, it is full of bangers and silly lines and music that tickles my lizard brain. A good time is infectious, and 100 gecs always know how to deliver that have-fun virus.
Covet	catharsis	April 7	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	math-rock	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WQ+qtHrvL.jpg	Yvette Young brings all of her guitar playing virtuoso to bear in catharsis. Melodies move beyond comprehension and the listener is left to wonder how this degree of skill is acquired, let alone utilized to effectively on an album as pretty and deep as this one.
Feist	Multitudes	April 14	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	indie, alternative, pop	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SZzwkiOIL.jpg	Feist contains Multitudes. 
The Japanese House	In The End It Always Does	July 5	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	indie,electronic	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611pxWcH9CL.jpg	The Japanese House has perfected their pop ambitions with In The End It Always Does and put together a salvo of hits in their ephemeral, sunshine-on-a-breezy-day style.
Fiddlehead	Death Is Nothing To Us	August 21	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	emo, hardcore	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Ax2tJ5PfL.jpg	Massachusetts hardcore outfit Fiddlehead mince no words and waste no time on Death Is Nothing To Us, indulging in the anxiety and reprieve that only the best hardcore bands can summon.
Slowdive	everything is alive	September 5	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	shoegaze	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JNcG2B57L.jpg	While I agree this album wasn't as stupendous as their eoponymous hiatus ender, Slowdive still continues to perfect the genre they helped found and codify and I find this additional to their canon almost as compelling as the last.
Oneohtrix Point Never	Again	September 29	9.0	4.4	★★★★✬	electronic, dark	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Ui841L-8L.jpg	OPN uses Again to embrace the ambient electronic soundscapes his albums are wont for. But in the crevaces of drum machines and synths lie melodies and motifs that bind the songs together and call forth one's attention in a way standard ambient music cannot.
